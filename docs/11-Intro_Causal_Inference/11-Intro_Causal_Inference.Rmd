# More on the ATT

.display1[Why might one use the ATT?]

- In some scenarios, we might be more interested in the causal effect of a treatment on the subset of individuals *who actually receive the treatment*!

--

From [Ho et al. (2007)](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/matchp.pdf):

> In our example, this is the average causal effect in districts in which the Democratic Party nominated the incumbent member of the House. From one perspective, we might want to know this treatment effect on the treated (the ATT) since obviously this is the group of districts where the treatment was applied. In other words, the ATT is the effect of the treatment actually applied. Medical studies typically use the ATT as the designated quantity of interest because they often only care about the causal effect of drugs for patients that receive or would receive the drugs. For another example, in job training programs, we are not normally interested in assigning employed people to have this training.

Is your decision to take a class *independent* of any *potential benefits* of the class?

- Probably not...

--

**IF** $[Y(1), Y(0)] \perp T$: 

$$E[Y(1)\mid T = 1] = E[Y(1)\mid T = 0] = E[Y(1)]$$

In this case, **potential outcomes** and **treatment assignment** are independent!

- But *usually*, we can't just take a simple **difference in means** and call it causal!!!

.display2[What this means] 👇

- $E[Y(1)\mid T = 1] = E[Y(1)\mid T = 0] = E[Y(1)]$

- $E[Y(0)\mid T = 0] = E[Y(0)\mid T = 1] = E[Y(0)]$

.display1[What this means] 👇

- Group A's **potential outcomes** for **T = 1** are *equal* to Group B's **potential outcomes** for **T = 1** (on average). 

- Group B's **potential outcomes** for **T = 0** are *equal* to Group A's **potential outcomes** for **T = 0** (on average). 

---

# Conditional Exchangeability

In many studies (e.g., .display1[observational studies]), **exchangeability** does not hold. 

- There is *usually* some reason for treatment selection that could **also** impact the outcome. 

- **Example**: .display2[Taking STAT 227] might be a **common cause** of...
    - **taking STAT 228**
    - an *increase* (😐 hopefully 😐) in **love of statistics**

--

By **controlling** for these common causes (e.g., holding constant in a regression model), we can hope to achieve .display1[conditional exchangeability]: $$ \Large [Y(1), Y(0)] \perp T\mid X$$

> Treatment assignment has **nothing to do** with potential benefits of the treatment, **within levels of the measured variables**.

- Also known as the **no unmeasured confounding** assumption!

# Some Notes

We just performed .display2[exact matching] to 

- (i) impute missing potential outcomes and 
- (ii) generate an *estimate* of the **ATT** (average treatment effect **on the treated**)

--

Remember, the *treated* individuals still have only one **observed** outcome!. 

- We *imputed* each $Y(0)$ by using the **observed** outcomes of *control* individuals with the **EXACT** same `age` as their match in the treatment group. 

--

By matching on the *confounder* `age`, we have achieved **exact** *covariate balance* on `age`. 

- Conditional on `age`, the two groups are **exchangeable**: $$[Y(1), Y(0)]\perp T\mid X$$

# Recap

We used .display1[exact matching] to create a .display2[matching estimator] to estimate the .display3[ATT] in an *observational study* comparing two treatment groups. 

- In the (fake) study of effects of an R Workshop on a STAT score among tech company employees, `age` was a **confounder**. 

- The two treatment groups were *different* (on `age`) in ways that were likely directly related to their potential outcomes. 

- In the matched sample, the .display1[R Workshop] and .display3[Control] groups were **balanced** on `age`. 

--

We performed .display1[exact matching], so individuals are matched *only if* their covariate values are EQUAL. 

- What if covariate values are *close*, or there are *many* covariates? 🤔

---

class: center, middle, frame

# Approximate Matching

# Limitations of Exact Matching

**Exact matching** can break down when we are matching on a *large* number of covariates. 

- It's much less likely for two individuals to be exactly the same on (for example) 10 characteristics, compared to one!

🤔👉 In this case, how can we determine .display1["closeness"] between two individuals to be matched?

# Nearest-Neighbor Covariate Matching

In .display2[nearest-neighbor matching], we find *untreated* observations that are similar (i.e., **very close**) to *treated* observations based on .display1[confounders]. 

--

There are a lot of fairly technical ways to measure "distance" between **vectors** of covariates. 

- .display1[Euclidean Distance]: $$||X_{i}-X_{j}||=\sqrt{(X_{i}-X_{j})'(X_{i}-X_{j})}$$

- .display2[Mahalanobis Distance]: $$\sqrt{(X_{i}-X_{j})'\boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1}(X_{i}-X_{j})}$$

# Finding the Matching Estimator

Once we have the .display2[matched dataset], we could plug this into an `lm()` to see what the ATT is!

```{r}
model_matched_data = lm(score ~ r_workshop, data = matched_data)
tidy(model_matched_data)
```
